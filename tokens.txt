It is precisely the type of challenge for which CPRI was created – bringing together multiple disciplines in academia, business, and government to solve hard but vitally important challenges. We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for supporting this work.”“Cooperating on cybersecurity really is a grand challenge,” noted Charles Eagan, BlackBerry’s chief technology officer.  “It’s not just a technical problem. If 5G operators and their clients are going to work together to share cybersecurity intelligence in real-time, we will have to also solve policy and regulatory challenges and build a trustworthy foundation for our cooperation. I’m very excited to partner with UCI and CPRI in this innovative program to help address this grand challenge.”– SourceUCI NewsUCI and BlackBerry Win NSF Convergence Accelerator Grant< PreviousThe Computer Errors From Outer SpaceNext >Faculty researchers secure another workforce development grant to support growth of machinists in manufacturingMore news and eventsNews StoriesVideo highlightsAnnual reportsCalendar of eventsMedia InquiriesMedia interested in interviewing ICS faculty, students or alumni should contact Matt Miller at (949) 824-1562 ormatt.miller@uci.eduTweets by UCIbrenICSView Social MediaDonald Bren School of Information and Computer SciencesUniversity of California, Irvine6210 Donald Bren HallIrvine, CA 92697-3425UCI HomepageUCI DirectoryFaculty & StaffEmploymentICS IntranetResearch DevelopmentKay Family Foundation LabFacilitiesNewsEventsMap & DirectionsAccessibility StatementSafety ProceduresPrivacy PolicyCoronavirus ResourcesApplyContactGift©  UCI Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences➤
